CHARITY SHARE
Help those in need by sharing items you no longer use!

Charity Share is a thoughtful app that enables users to effectively manage and donate items they no longer need to various charitable organizations. This app will inform you of items that are available for donation and help you find nearby charities or donation centers where these items can be delivered. By using Charity Share, you can easily contribute to the community, save resources, and make a positive impact.

Every day, countless items that could be of value to others end up being discarded.
